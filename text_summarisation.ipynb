Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a que stion from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens.

However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity.

      "Speech:The speech is an address by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the former President of India, as he is about to leave office after serving five years. He expresses gratitude to the people of India and those living abroad for their cooperation and support during his tenure. He highlights the importance of 10 key messages that he believes are crucial for India's development:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerating development to meet the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "2. Empowering villages\n",
      "3. Leveraging rural core competence for competitiveness\n",
      "4. Fostering agricultural growth through \"Seed to Food\"\n",
      "5. Overcoming problems and succeeding\n",
      "6. Partnering to overcome challenges\n",
      "7. Displaying courage in combating calamities\n",

      "9. Defending the nation's pride\n",
      "10. Launching a youth movement to make India a developed nation by 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "He shares a personal anecdote about a young girl named Anukriti who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He assures her that it's a thoughtful question and expresses his confidence in India's potential to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question and thanked the person for asking. They assured that the person's dream would be taken to the highest institution of the country and that they would work towards making it happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of India's youth to live in a developed and prosperous country by 2020. The speaker, likely the President of India at the time, shares their experience visiting a village in Nagaland where they saw an empowered village council making decisions and taking initiatives for development. The speaker emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and providing physical connectivity through quality roads to enable faster movement of products and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also highlights an initiative by Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore, which is working towards providing urban amenities in rural areas through the PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex. This initiative includes provision of physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic connectivity, and has resulted in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs. The speaker seems to be advocating for a similar approach to be applied to all 600,000 villages in India, empowering them to deal with their development and connecting them with urban societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) initiative in Thanjavur district. Through the support of 1000 self-help groups, 200 acres of wasteland has been converted into cultivable land, and villagers are now engaged in activities such as planting Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, bio-mass power generation, food processing, and marketing. The initiative has also enabled villagers to develop internationally competitive products with the help of experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO). The speaker believes that this model can be replicated across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with an estimated 7000 PURAs needed to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. The first experience was meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, who showed keen interest in the various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of doubling agricultural production with reduced resources and improving economic conditions through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience was meeting Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a person who was born without hands and legs, but had a radiant and happy demeanor. Despite his physical limitations, he had a strong sense of confidence and purpose, and expressed a desire to sing in front of the speaker. The speaker was inspired by Vidwan's optimism and resilience, and reflects on the importance of defeating problems and succeeding in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two stories:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The first story is about a physically challenged individual who has a hidden talent for music. Despite his disabilities, he was encouraged by his parents, teachers, and others to pursue his passion, and he eventually performed in front of a large audience at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre. The speaker uses this story to illustrate the importance of positive attitude and perseverance in overcoming obstacles.\n",
      "2. The second story is about the resilience of the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe damage to their school building and personal losses, the villagers showed courage and determination in rebuilding their lives. The speaker praises their ability to take charge of their problems rather than letting them control them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall message of the speech seems to be about overcoming challenges and obstacles through partnership, perseverance, and a positive attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be a reflection on the author's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and calamities. The author recounts their visit to a village affected by an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief operations and even interacting with the author while smiling. The author also mentions a previous visit to Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where they were touched by the courage and compassion of the tribal islanders, who had taken in affected victims as their own and showed no signs of despair.\n",
      "\n",
      "The author also references a poem they composed, \"Sea Waves\", which celebrates the courage and determination of the people who live in areas prone to natural disasters. The poem is sung by the villagers, who exhibit courage and enthusiasm despite having gone through severe suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the author mentions their address to the Pan African Parliament in 2004, where they discussed the importance of connectivity for societal transformation. However, the details of this part of the speech are not provided in the summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a summary of the speech:\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed a concept called the \"Pan African e-Network\" to connect 53 African countries with a seamless and integrated network of satellite, fiber optics, and wireless connections at a cost of $100 million. The project aims to connect 12 universities, 17 hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers across Africa. A pilot project for tele-education and tele-medicine has already been launched in Ethiopia, with India's Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to Ethiopian students and specialists from CARE Hospital providing telemedicine services.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the speaker's experiences and achievements in various fields. The speaker mentions that Hyderabad is providing tele-consultation services to doctors in Ethiopia's Black Lion Hospital, and that the Pan African network will connect all 53 African countries for instant communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker also expresses pride in India's defense forces, describing their bravery and dedication to duty in challenging circumstances. They mention their own experiences visiting military bases, presenting colors to regiments, and interacting with troops and families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the speaker mentions a youth movement called \"Lead India 2020\" which aims to transform Indian youth into enlightened citizens. They met with a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the importance of transforming Indian youth into enlightened citizens. They mention the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, particularly in Medak district, in partnership with the district administration. The speaker notes that the training has had a positive impact on the students, leading to self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. They also share a personal anecdote about a student leader who was inspired to help her father quit smoking after participating in the training. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of empowering India's 540 million youth below the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership, considering them the most powerful resource on the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural heritage and civilization for future generations. The speaker highlights the country's progress in the last 60 years and its potential for growth, thanks to its natural resources and hardworking people, particularly its youth. The speaker encourages everyone to strive to empower each other and work towards achieving the goal of a developed India by 2020. The speech outlines five key aspects that India should strive to achieve:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Reduced rural-urban divide\n",
      "2. Equitable access to energy and quality water\n",
      "3. Harmonious collaboration between agriculture, industry, and service sectors\n",
      "4. Education with values available to all, regardless of societal or economic background\n",
      "5. India becoming a top destination for talented scholars, scientists, and investors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech ends with a quote from a famous poem, emphasizing the idea that anything is possible if one aims high and works towards it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is outlining their vision for a ideal nation, with 9 key goals:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Good health care available to all\n",
      "2. Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance\n",
      "3. Total eradication of poverty and illiteracy\n",
      "4. Zero crimes against women and children, and no feelings of alienation\n",
      "5. A prosperous, healthy, secure, peaceful, and happy society with sustainable growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, the President of India, concludes by expressing gratitude to the citizens for their support and cooperation over the past five years. He shares his life's mission to bring people together and instill confidence in the nation, emphasizing that \"we can do it\" to achieve greatness. He reaffirms his commitment to working with the citizens to make India a developed nation by 2020 and ends with a prayer for God's blessings and a declaration of \"Jai hind\" (Victory to India).\n",
